Fix that darn cleaning standardizing bug in the grammar editor
DONE

The cultivation process is really pigging out if we go more than 2 levels or so. Debug that.

Put a "create bubblemodel mode" in the jig editor so we can just create our new bubblemodel right 
there rather than going back to the overview etc.
Maybe merge the 2 editors?

YES
rather than looking through a list of bubblemodels and trying to fit one to whatever geometric context, just
draw a shape. Then the machine finds a matching bubblemodel. If no such bubblemodel exists then create a new one.

It won't even be a mode, it will be the new way that the jig editor works.

So we're looking at 2 ways to create bubblemodels : out of context and in context.
