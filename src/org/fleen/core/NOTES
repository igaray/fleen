A better way to do foams

when we want to have a new foam we create one and the foam is set for a bubble. References both ways. This bubble is the foam's "root bubble", this foam is the bubble's foam. A foam has 1 root bubble, a bubble has 1 foam which is either null or a foam.

To get all of a foam's bubbles, get the foam's root bubble and traverse the tree down from there, gathering all bubbles for which foam is null, up to but not including the next nonnull foam bubble.

To get the foam of a bubble, get the foam of that bubble. If it's null then go up the tree until a nonnull is found. That's the foam
